# NotesApp
An Notes Application Using Node.js

# Hey Terminal lover users💖
Here I am created a notes app using node.js in which you can create notes with title and body. You can 
manage your notes by terminal(in windows prefer powershell) and through terminal you can view all of them at a time(as a list)
delete them and read them😃.

# Usage
It might helpful when you want to save some code snippets, Your todo list, you can also save your passwords(PS: Hidden your password file)😊.

# Precations
While using the code of notes app, Beaware of the the version you are installing or installed of required npm modules. 
If version mismatched then it may throw error because in every 6-months(nearly) npm-modules updates and node.js 
also updates and it might possible that functions used in code are deprecated or update😓😓.
<h4>You can find mine used version in package.json file.</h4>

<h3>Any further Updates and Ideas are Welcome ❤.</h3>
